# Day 38: Pull Docker Image

Nautilus project developers are planning to start testing on a new project. As per their meeting with the DevOps team, they want to test containerized environment application features. As per details shared with DevOps team, we need to accomplish the following task:

a. Pull `busybox:musl` image on `App Server 2` in Stratos DC and re-tag (create new tag) this image as `busybox:media`.

💡 **Note:** You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the **Details of all Users and Servers** button on the top-right section of the page.

## 🔹 Step 1: Connect to App Server 3

```bash
ssh steve@stapp02
sudo su -
```

**Purpose**: Connect to Application Server 3 as banner user and switch to root for Docker operations.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Verify Docker service is running

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

**Purpose**: Ensure Docker daemon is running before performing image operations.

**Expected Output**:
```
● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
   Active: active (running)
```

**If not running**:
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Check existing Docker images (optional)

```bash
docker images
```

**Purpose**: View currently available Docker images on the system before pulling new ones.

**Initial State**: May be empty or contain previously downloaded images.

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Pull the busybox:musl image

```bash
docker pull busybox:musl
```

**Purpose**: Download the busybox image with musl tag from Docker Hub registry.

**Expected Output**:
```
musl: Pulling from library/busybox
5c3b447848a9: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:32b5cdad7cce41dfd53d0ae06baebcf8357a147ee7694dc7xxxxx
Status: Downloaded newer image for busybox:musl
docker.io/library/busybox:musl
```

**Pull Process**:
- Connects to Docker Hub
- Downloads image layers
- Verifies layer integrity
- Stores image locally

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Verify image was pulled successfully

```bash
docker images busybox
```

**Purpose**: Confirm the busybox:musl image is now available locally.

**Expected Output**:
```
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
busybox      musl      654fc8fd836e   3 months ago   1.53MB
```

**Image Details**:
- **Repository**: busybox
- **Tag**: musl
- **Image ID**: Unique identifier
- **Size**: Approximately 1.53MB

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Create new tag for the image

```bash
docker tag busybox:musl busybox:media
```

**Purpose**: Create an additional tag pointing to the same image for local reference purposes.

**Tag Operation**:
- Creates new reference to existing image
- Does not duplicate image data
- Same Image ID for both tags
- No network operation required

---

## 🔹 Step 7: Verify both tags exist

```bash
docker images busybox
```

**Purpose**: Confirm both tags (musl and media) are now available for the same image.

**Expected Output**:
```
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
busybox      media     654fc8fd836e   3 months ago   1.53MB
busybox      musl      654fc8fd836e   3 months ago   1.53MB
```

**Key Observation**: 
- ✅ Both tags share the **same Image ID** (654fc8fd836e)
- ✅ No additional disk space used
- ✅ Both tags point to identical image data

---

## 🔹 Step 8: Inspect the image details

```bash
docker inspect busybox:media
```

**Purpose**: View detailed information about the tagged image configuration and layers.

**Useful Information**:
- Container configuration
- Environment variables
- Entry point and command
- Layer information
- Creation timestamp

---

## 🔹 Step 9: Test the image functionality

```bash
docker run --rm busybox:media echo "Testing media tag"
```

**Purpose**: Verify the newly tagged image works correctly by running a test container.

**Expected Output**:
```
Testing media tag
```

**Test Explanation**:
- `--rm`: Automatically remove container after exit
- `echo`: Simple command to verify functionality
- Container exits after executing command

---

## 🔹 Step 10: Compare both tags

```bash
docker run --rm busybox:musl echo "Testing musl tag"
docker run --rm busybox:media echo "Testing media tag"
```

**Purpose**: Demonstrate that both tags reference the same functional image.

**Expected Behavior**: Both commands produce identical results as they use the same image.

---

## 📋 Quick Command Reference

For quick copy-paste, execute on **App Server 3**:

```bash
# Connect to server
ssh banner@stapp03
sudo su -

# Verify Docker and pull image
systemctl status docker
docker pull busybox:musl

# Create new tag
docker tag busybox:musl busybox:media

# Verify both tags
docker images busybox

# Test functionality (optional)
docker run --rm busybox:media echo "Test successful"
```

---

## 💡 Additional Tips

- **Image tags**: Tags are just labels pointing to image IDs
- **No duplication**: Retagging doesn't consume additional storage
- **Multiple tags**: Single image can have unlimited tags
- **Local operation**: Tagging is local and doesn't affect Docker Hub
- **Naming convention**: Use descriptive tags for different purposes

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue 1: Docker pull fails**
**Symptoms**: Cannot connect to Docker registry or timeout errors
**Solution**: Check network connectivity and Docker daemon status
```bash
systemctl status docker
docker info
ping registry-1.docker.io
```

### **Issue 2: Permission denied errors**
**Symptoms**: Regular user cannot run Docker commands
**Solution**: Use sudo or add user to docker group
```bash
sudo docker pull busybox:musl
# or
sudo usermod -aG docker banner
```

### **Issue 3: Disk space issues**
**Symptoms**: No space left on device during pull
**Solution**: Clean up unused images and containers
```bash
docker system df
docker image prune
docker system prune
```

### **Issue 4: Tag already exists**
**Symptoms**: Warning about overwriting existing tag
**Solution**: This is normal behavior; tag will point to new image
```bash
# Force tag creation
docker tag -f busybox:musl busybox:media
```

## 🚨 Task-Specific Challenge & Solution

**🔍 Main Challenge Encountered:**

The primary challenge was **pulling a specific Docker image variant and creating an alternative local tag** for team reference purposes while understanding Docker's image tagging system and layer sharing.

**💡 Solution Approach:**

1. **Service Verification**: Confirmed Docker daemon was running and ready for image operations
2. **Image Pull Operation**: Downloaded busybox:musl image from Docker Hub registry using docker pull command
3. **Tag Creation**: Used docker tag command to create alternative busybox:media reference pointing to same image
4. **Verification Process**: Confirmed both tags exist and share identical Image ID
5. **Functionality Testing**: Validated that newly tagged image works correctly by running test containers
6. **Image Inspection**: Verified image details to understand configuration and layer structure

**🎯 Key Success Factors:**
- **Specific variant selection** pulling exact busybox:musl variant as specified
- **Tagging understanding** recognizing tags as references, not duplicates
- **Image ID awareness** understanding both tags point to same underlying image
- **No storage overhead** confirming retagging doesn't consume additional disk space
- **Local operation** recognizing tagging is local and doesn't affect remote registry
- **Testing procedures** validating functionality with both original and new tags

**⚠️ Critical Configuration Details:**
- **Image specification** must include both repository and tag (busybox:musl)
- **Tag syntax** uses format `docker tag source:tag destination:tag`
- **Image ID consistency** both tags must show identical Image ID after tagging
- **Registry behavior** pull operation downloads from Docker Hub by default
- **Local scope** tags are local references and not pushed to registry automatically

**🔒 Docker Image Management Benefits:**
- **Flexible naming** allows different tags for same image for different purposes
- **Storage efficiency** multiple tags share same image layers
- **Version management** enables semantic versioning and release naming
- **Team collaboration** provides descriptive references for shared images

## ⚠️ Important Production Notes

🔧 **Image Management**: Multiple tags enable flexible image organization without storage duplication

🔐 **Local References**: Tags provide meaningful names for team collaboration and deployment workflows

📊 **Storage Efficiency**: Image tagging doesn't consume additional disk space as tags share underlying layers

🛡️ **Registry Operations**: Pull operations download from Docker Hub while tags remain local until explicitly pushed
