# Day 27 - Git Revert Some Changes

The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog` present on `Storage server` in `Stratos DC`. However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo HEAD to last commit. Below are more details about the task:

In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog` git repository, revert the latest commit `( HEAD)` to the previous commit (JFYI the previous commit hash should be with `initial commit` message).

Use `revert blog` message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Connect to Storage Server

```bash
ssh natasha@ststor01
sudo su -
```

**Purpose**: Connect to the storage server (ststor01) as natasha user and switch to root for administrative access.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Navigate to repository directory

```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
```

**Purpose**: Navigate to the target Git repository where the revert operation will be performed.

**Verify location**:
```bash
pwd
ls
ls -la
```
---

## 🔹 Step 3: Examine current Git history

```bash
git log
git log --oneline
```

**Purpose**: View the commit history to understand what will be reverted.

**Expected Output Example**:
```
abc1234 Latest commit message (HEAD)
def5678 initial commit
```

**Alternative detailed view**:
```bash
git log -n 3
```

**Important Notes**:
- **HEAD commit**: The latest commit that needs to be reverted
- **Previous commit**: Should contain "initial commit" message
- **Commit hashes**: Note these for verification purposes

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Check repository status before revert

```bash
git status
```

**Purpose**: Ensure the working directory is clean before performing the revert operation.

**Expected Output**:
```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Clean Status Required**: Repository should have no uncommitted changes before reverting.

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Perform the revert operation

```bash
git revert HEAD
```

**Purpose**: Revert the changes introduced by the latest commit (HEAD).

**Process**:
1. Git will open a text editor for the commit message
2. Default message will be something like "Revert '[original commit message]'"
3. **Replace** the default message with **"revert blog"**
4. Save and exit the editor

**Editor Actions**:
- **In vi/vim**: Press `i` to edit, type message, press `Esc`, type `:wq`, press `Enter`
- **In nano**: Edit message, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Alternative method with direct commit message

```bash
git revert HEAD -m "revert blog"
```

**Purpose**: Perform revert operation with commit message specified directly in command.

**Use this if**: You prefer to avoid the interactive editor approach.

**Note**: The `-m` flag allows specifying the commit message directly.

---

## 🔹 Step 7: Verify the revert commit was created

```bash
git log
```

**Purpose**: Confirm that the revert commit was created with the correct message.

**Expected Output**:

**Verification Points**:
- **New HEAD**: Should show "revert games" commit message
- **Commit order**: Revert commit on top, followed by original commits
- **History preservation**: All previous commits remain in history

---

## 🔹 Step 8: Check repository status after revert

```bash
git status
```

**Purpose**: Verify that the revert operation completed cleanly.

**Expected Output**:
```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

## 🔹 Step 9: Verify file changes were reverted

```bash
ls -la
git diff HEAD~2 HEAD
```

**Purpose**: Compare the current state with the state before the reverted commit to confirm changes were undone.

**Alternative verification**:
```bash
git show HEAD
```

**Expected Result**: Should show the revert commit with changes that undo the previous commit.

---

## 🔹 Step 10: Check specific file content (if applicable)

```bash
cat blog.txt  # If this file exists
```

**Purpose**: Verify that file contents match the expected state after revert.

**File State**: Should reflect the content as it was before the reverted commit.

---

## 📋 Quick Command Reference

For quick copy-paste, execute on **Storage Server (ststor01)**:

```bash
# Connect and navigate
ssh natasha@ststor01
sudo su -
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
ls
git log

# Examine current state
git log
git status

# Perform revert
git revert HEAD
# (Edit commit message to "revert blog" in editor)

# Alternative: Direct commit message
git revert HEAD -m "revert ecommerce"

# Verify revert
git log
git status
```

---

## 💡 Additional Tips

- **History preservation**: `git revert` creates a new commit instead of removing history
- **Safe operation**: Revert is safer than `git reset` as it doesn't rewrite history
- **Commit message**: Use descriptive messages to document why revert was needed
- **Multiple commits**: Use `git revert <hash1> <hash2>` to revert multiple commits
- **Merge commits**: Reverting merge commits requires `-m` flag with parent number

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue 1: Editor doesn't open or is unfamiliar**
**Symptoms**: Strange editor opens or command hangs
**Solution**: Set your preferred editor or use direct message flag
```bash
export EDITOR=nano  # or vi, vim, etc.
# Or use direct message approach:
git revert HEAD -m "revert games"
```

### **Issue 2: Revert fails due to conflicts**
**Symptoms**: Git reports merge conflicts during revert
**Solution**: Resolve conflicts manually and complete revert
```bash
# Edit conflicted files to resolve conflicts
git add <resolved-files>
git revert --continue
```

### **Issue 3: Wrong commit gets reverted**
**Symptoms**: Reverted the wrong commit
**Solution**: Revert the revert commit to restore original state
```bash
git log --oneline  # Find the revert commit hash
git revert <revert-commit-hash>
```

### **Issue 4: Working directory not clean**
**Symptoms**: Cannot revert due to uncommitted changes
**Solution**: Commit or stash changes before reverting
```bash
git stash  # Temporarily save changes
git revert HEAD
git stash pop  # Restore changes if needed
```

## 🚨 Task-Specific Challenge & Solution

**🔍 Main Challenge Encountered:**

The primary challenge was **safely reverting the latest commit while preserving Git history** and ensuring the revert commit uses the exact specified commit message format.

**💡 Solution Approach:**

1. **History Analysis**: Examined current Git log to identify HEAD commit and verify previous commit contains "initial commit" message
2. **Clean State Verification**: Confirmed working directory was clean before performing revert operation
3. **Revert Operation**: Used `git revert HEAD` to create new commit that undoes changes from latest commit
4. **Commit Message Management**: Specified exact commit message "revert games" (lowercase) as required
5. **Verification Process**: Confirmed revert commit creation and validated that changes were properly undone
6. **History Integrity**: Ensured all previous commits remain in history while new revert commit is added

**🎯 Key Success Factors:**
- **Safe revert method** using `git revert` instead of destructive `git reset` commands
- **History preservation** maintaining complete commit history while undoing specific changes
- **Commit message accuracy** using exact lowercase format "revert games" as specified
- **State verification** confirming clean working directory before and after revert operation
- **Change validation** verifying that reverted changes match expected repository state
- **Process documentation** following proper Git workflow for collaborative development

**⚠️ Critical Operation Details:**
- **Revert vs Reset** - `git revert` creates new commit, `git reset` rewrites history
- **HEAD targeting** - specifically reverting the most recent commit (HEAD)
- **Message format** - exact lowercase "revert games" message as required
- **History integrity** - all previous commits preserved in chronological order
- **Working directory** - must be clean before revert operation

**🔒 Git History Benefits:**
- **Audit trail** - complete record of what was changed and when it was reverted
- **Collaboration safety** - other developers can see the revert in shared repository
- **Recovery capability** - revert commits can themselves be reverted if needed
- **Timeline preservation** - maintains chronological development history

## ⚠️ Important Production Notes

🔧 **Safe History Management**: Revert operation preserves complete Git history while undoing specific commit changes

🔐 **Collaboration Friendly**: Other team members can see revert commit in shared repository history

📊 **Change Tracking**: Revert commit provides clear documentation of what changes were undone and when

🛡️ **Recovery Options**: Revert commits can be reverted themselves if original changes need to be restored
